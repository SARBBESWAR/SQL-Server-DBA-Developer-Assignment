Common Performance Tuning Techniques in SQL Server
Identify Performance Bottlenecks
	Slow Queries- Use DMVs like sys.dm_exec_query_stats to find long-running queries.
	Execution Plans- Check for table scans, missing indexes, and costly operations.
	Activity Monitor - View real-time performance issues (CPU, memory, blocking).
	Wait Stats - Use sys.dm_os_wait_stats to see where SQL Server is waiting (e.g., disk, CPU, locks).

How to Fix Performance Issues
	Indexing - Add missing indexes. Remove unused or duplicate indexes.
	Query Optimization - Avoid SELECT *, Filter early using WHERE.
	Update Statistics - Keep table stats up to date to help the query optimizer.
	Fix Blocking & Deadlocks - Keep transactions short and Use correct isolation levels.
